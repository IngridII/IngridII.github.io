<h1>NEW MOON</h1>
<img src="newmoon.jpg" alt="newmoon">

<p>New moon occurs when the moon is on the same side of Earth as the sun. New moons generally can't be seen. They cross the sky with the sun during the day, and the moon's shadow side is pointed toward Earth. A new moon is visible only during a solar eclipse</p>
