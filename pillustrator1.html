  <title>A Shell Dream</title>
  <h1>statement</h1>

  <p>This piece titled shell dream was created using Adobe illustrator and was inspired by a dream I once had when I was a child.
    Like everyone else I’ve had many dreams but this particular dream always stuck with me partly because of its fantastical nature
    but also because it felt as though my subconscious was trying to deliver a message to me. Today I still haven’t come to a conclusion as to
     what that dream meant but in giving the dream a somewhat physical representation I feel as though I've come a bit close to understanding it. </p>
