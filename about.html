  <h1>About The Artist</h1>
  <p>Ingrid Smith is a Digital Media Art student attending San Jose state university.
    She is currently learning how to use photoshop and is proficient in illustrator.
     She has a background in traditional styles of art including pencil drawing, inking,
     and oil painting. Her work usually contains a fantastical element and has worked mainly 2
     dimensionally. She has aspirations to one day create 3 dimensional environments. </p>
     <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
     <p>I grew up and lived In Belize until the age of ten when I moved to USA. It's a small country
       in central america so understandably certain views I was raised around were not the most progressive
        or modern. However my window to new and sometimes fantastical ideas were Television and video games.
        I was lucky enough to have a mother who didn't mind how long me and my brothers spent playing video games
         and watching tv. Movies and shows like the matrix, lord of the rings, and digimon etc taught us that there
          could be more to the world than what we see around us. That idea has stuck with me and bleed into my art
          practice. Throughout my time as an artist I’ve learned that your art is never just what you intended it to be. It’s not
          just your topic or theme, it's something similar to a living being that takes on a life of its own. When you labor over
           your artwork you give it a piece of your soul. The same way you might when you give birth to a child and just like a child
           your artwork has the ability to transform beyond the scope of your original intention.</p>
