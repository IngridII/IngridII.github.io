  <h1>Artists's Statement</h1>
  <p>This piece was created in Illustrator using myself as inspiration for
    the design. I'm known by my family for having a large quantity of
    hair and glasses, so those are elements that were incorporated into the design. The color choices
     were made based on one of my favorite color combinations, red and black. The over all
     creaturesque look of the figure was chosen because of the my fondness of fantasy art. </p>
