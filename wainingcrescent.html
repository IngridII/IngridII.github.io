<img src="wainingcrescent.jpeg" alt="waining crescent">
<p>The Waning Crescent phase occurs when the illumination of the Moon decreases from 49.9% to 0.1%. It is an intermediary phase between the Third Quarter and the New Moon (when the Moon is almost invisible). ... In this phase, the Moon looks like a boat or a banana. Waning means the Moon is getting smaller</p>
