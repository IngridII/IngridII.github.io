  <h1>Statement</h1>

  <p>The conception of this piece titled Church Vampire started with the remembrance of a meme. The meme in question was a screenshot of a popular british tv show with the caption under it “no one expects the Spanish Inquisition ''. I’ve repeated that phrase several times amongst my friends but I never knew exactly what the Spanish inquisition was. I grew up catholic, I was baptized and attended Catholic school until I was ten years old so I had vague knowledge that the spanish inquisition was somehow related to catholicism. When the meme emerged from my memories I decided to do research into what exactly was the Spanish inquisition. My research led me to discovery of one of the worst times in the history of the catholic church.


To give you a brief overview, the Spanish Inquisition occurred in medieval Spain and started with a cardinal's attempt to remove heretics from Spain. Well The inquisition started with that purpose in mind but it quickly devolved into something that was much more sadistic in nature. Neighbors would report each other because of jealousy or for some other purely petty reason. When the inquisitors came they would torture that individual until they confessed to the false allegations. It was like christianity had turned into a tool for people to express the worst sides of their humanity. The inquisition continued until the pope at the time decided that it was transforming into something terrible. The cardinal that started it managed to escape prosecution but by that time many people died and were tortured and the officials and clergy members had become very rich from seizing assets front those people.

 After discovering all this I was horrified because the religion that I was a part of caused something so terrible to happen. While thinking about this I transferred all of those feelings into the creation of my piece. I chose the imagery of a vampire's skull to represent the death and greed of the church. The initial sentiment of the inquisition was to remove all evil from the country but by the end the church itself had evolved into that evil thing. The church turned into a greedy vampire sucking the blood and gold from the people. Church vampire was created as a reminder or a marker of a terrible tragedy.</p>
